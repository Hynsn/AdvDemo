If you're an older adult, balance exercises are especially important because they can help you prevent falls and maintain your independence. It's a good idea to include balance training along with physical activity and strength training in your regular activity.</div> <br><div>Nearly any activity that keeps you on your feet and moving, such as walking, can help you maintain good balance. But specific exercises designed to enhance your balance are beneficial to include in your daily routine and can help improve your stability.</div> <br><div>For example, balance on one foot while you're standing for a period of time at home or when you're out and about. Or, stand up from a seated position without using your hands. Or try walking in a line, heel to toe, for a short distance. You can also try tai chi — a form of movement training that may improve balance and stability and reduce the incidence of falls.</div> <br><div>If you have severe balance problems or an orthopedic condition, get your doctor's OK before doing balance exercises.</div> <br><h3>Weight shifts</h3><img src="https://testonline-image.vesync.com/recipeThirdPartImage/v1/2022-08-01-89bfc877-1a49-4914-a214-1232c7aba908.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Man" doing="" weight="" shifts=""/> <div>When you're ready to try balance exercises, start with weight shifts:</div> <br><ul>    <li style = "margin: 10px 0;">Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your weight equally distributed on both legs (A).</li>    <li style = "margin: 10px 0;">Shift your weight to your right side, then lift your left foot off the floor (B).</li>    <li style = "margin: 10px 0;">Hold the position as long as you can maintain good form, up to 30 seconds.</li>    <li style = "margin: 10px 0;">Return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.
